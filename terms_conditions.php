You acknowledge that during any Free Trial, the Service may have certain restrictions and limited functionality (e.g. a limit on the number of Screens that may be Paired). </li>
                  <li>On expiry of the Free Trial, you will have the option to either:
                    <ul class="mb-3">

                </ul>
                <h5>9. FREE TRIAL</h5>
                <p>You are only permitted to pair one screen per licence, unless you are using multiple screens in immediate proximity to the others (sometimes referred to as a “video wall”), in which case this can be considered one screen for the purposes of the licence. Note you will need the requisite hardware for this to work. For the avoidance of doubt, you are not permitted to split the signal from one device to power multiple screens not in immediate proximity without purchasing additional licences for each screen.</p>

                <p>Our Broadcast and Disploy Dashboards features are provided and priced on the assumption that they are used in a normal way for an organization. For example, it would not be normal to broadcast 24/7, nor would it be normal to display hundreds of different dashboards in succession on one screen.</p>
                <p> If you are using Space Based Billing and you have accounts on different tiers, you are not permitted to use features and functionality that are only available to more expensive tiers unless the paired screen has a licence on that tier.</p>
                <p>  If we believe that you are using the service in a way that falls outside of the Fair Usage Policy, we will speak to you to find a resolution which may include the need to apply additional fees.</p>
                <p>If you choose not to change your usage or pay any additional fees after we contact you under these Terms, you may discontinue the Service and receive a pro-rata refund for any remaining time in your Billing Period.</p>
                <p> If we cannot find a resolution, we reserve the right to Terminate your Account in accordance with clause 4.</p>
                <h5 class="mt-3">10. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h5>
                 <p>You hereby warrant that (a) all Users are at least 18 years old; (b) you have the right and capacity to enter into and be bound by these Terms; and (c) you shall comply with all applicable laws regarding the Use of the Service.</p>

                <p>  The Service is provided to assist with viewing Content on Screens and should not be used as a back-up facility. You should ensure that you and the Users have adequate back-up facilities for any Content and we shall not be liable for any losses or damages incurred by you or any Users arising out of or in connection with your failure to implement adequate back-up facilities in respect of any Content.</p>
                <p>  You acknowledge that we use compression techniques in order to relay Content on Screens, which may result in a reduction in the image quality when viewed on a Screen. We cannot guarantee that any attempt to Pair a Screen will be successful and may be subject to your selected Screen meeting certain specifications specified by us from time to time.</p>
